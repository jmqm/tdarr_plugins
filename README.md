<p align="center">A collection of my own Tdarr plugins.</p>

### Why create my own repo?

[HaveAGitGat's repo](https://github.com/HaveAGitGat/Tdarr_Plugins "HaveAGitGat's repo") has this clause:

> [...] After the plugin has been submitted to community plugins, you can only fix bugs, clarify details and improve plugin performance.

And I'm not really about that. I like the freedom of improving, removing or adding to a plugin later on.

### Some code look familiar...

I download a plugin from the community I like and I change it to the way I want. Credits are at the bottom of the files.
I don't program in vanilla JavaScript _( because I hate it )_ and it seems like Tdarr is doing something funky w/ them at times, so there will be questionable code.

### How do I use these scripts?

1. Download the script you want.
2. Navigate to the local plugins folder. In Docker, it's `server > Tdarr > Plugins > Local`.
3. Put the plugin in that folder.
4. Should now show up in your Plugins tab in Tdarr.
